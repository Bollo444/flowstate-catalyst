🚀 FlowState Catalyst
A Next.js-powered project management and flow state optimization platform

✨ Overview
FlowState Catalyst is an advanced project management and productivity enhancement platform designed to optimize flow states, streamline task management, and enable real-time collaboration.

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, it aims for high performance, scalability, and maintainability. The platform provides an intelligent workspace where teams can achieve peak performance through flow state tracking, automated task distribution, and data-driven insights.

🔧 System Architecture (Inferred from File Structure)
The application appears to follow a modular structure:

*   **Routing (`app/`, `pages/`):** Utilizes both Next.js App Router (`app/`) for primary features and API routes, and Pages Router (`pages/`) likely for specific sections (e.g., auth) or during migration. Suggests a potentially complex routing setup.
*   **UI Components (`components/`):** An extensive and well-categorized library of reusable React components (Core, Dashboard, Flow, Layout, Shared, Tasks, Team, etc.), indicating a mature frontend system. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
*   **State & Logic (`hooks/`, `services/`, `features/`):** Employs custom React Hooks for stateful logic, a service layer for business operations/API interactions, and feature modules for grouping related functionalities (e.g., `taskFlow`, `teamSync`).
*   **Backend (`app/api/`, `lib/`, `supabase/`):** Leverages Supabase for Backend-as-a-Service (database, auth) and Next.js API routes for custom backend endpoints.
*   **Data (`types/`, `supabase/database.ts`):** Uses TypeScript for type safety and defines data structures, including Supabase schema definitions.
*   **Analytics (`analytics/`):** Contains a vast number of directories, suggesting a very ambitious plan for detailed, multi-faceted analytics, though implementation depth is likely variable.
*   **Integrations (`integrations/`):** Modules for connecting with third-party services (currently showing Storage providers).
*   **Testing (`tests/`):** Includes structure for unit, integration, end-to-end, and performance tests, indicating testing is a priority.
*   **Utilities & Supporting (`utils/`, `styles/`, `validation/`, `monitoring/`, `debug/`):** Contains shared utilities, styling configuration, validation logic, performance monitoring tools, and debugging helpers.

🔑 Key Features (Inferred Status from File Structure)

*   ✅ **Authentication:** Likely functional, supported by Supabase and dedicated routes/components.
*   🚧 **Core Flow Interface:** Foundational elements exist (`components/core/FlowInterface`), advanced features like `Flowsistant` and `FlowWhispers` likely WIP.
*   🚧 **Task Management:** Extensive structure suggests core functionality (listing, viewing) exists, but advanced features (automation via `taskFlow`) likely WIP.
*   🚧 **Team Collaboration:** Core components and routes exist, real-time synchronization (`teamSync`) likely WIP.
*   🚧 **Project Management:** Basic structure present (`app/projects`, `hooks/useProjects`), depth unclear.
*   🚧 **Analytics Suite:** Foundational structure is vast, indicating significant ambition. Implementation of specific analytics types likely partial. Basic dashboard elements may be functional.
*   🚧 **Integrations:** Storage integration (Dropbox, Google Drive) structure exists, likely partially implemented.
*   ❓ **Inventory Management:** Structure exists (`app/inventory`), but implementation depth is unclear.
*   ❓ **Testing Framework:** Test structure exists across various types, but actual coverage is unknown.

*Status Legend:*
✅ = Core functionality likely present/well-developed based on structure.
🚧 = Partially implemented or Work-In-Progress inferred from structure.
❓ = Implementation depth or test coverage unknown from structure alone.

🏗 Project Completion Status (Estimated from File Structure)

Based on the file structure, the project appears to have a strong foundation, particularly on the frontend component side and basic integrations (Supabase). Significant work seems to remain in fully implementing backend logic, completing the advanced features (especially the extensive analytics suite and real-time aspects), ensuring comprehensive test coverage, and potentially consolidating the dual routing system.

*   🔥 **Overall Estimated Completion:** ~60-70%

*   **Key Areas Requiring Work (Inferred):**
    *   Full implementation of backend logic to support all features.
    *   Completing and integrating advanced features (Team Sync, Task Flow automation, Flowsistant, Analytics types).
    *   Implementing the logic for the numerous planned analytics modules.
    *   Ensuring robust test coverage across the application.
    *   Potential routing strategy refinement (`app/` vs `pages/`).
    *   Expanding documentation.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up FlowState Catalyst on your local machine:

1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd flowstate-catalyst
```
2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```
3️⃣ **Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add your Supabase credentials:

```ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
# Add other necessary environment variables if any (e.g., for AI features, integrations)
```
Replace `your-project-url` and `your-anon-key` with your actual Supabase credentials.

4️⃣ **Run the Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Now, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to explore the dashboard!
